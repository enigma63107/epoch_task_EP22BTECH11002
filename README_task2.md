# Epoch Task 2

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to perform a series of data preprocessing and machine learning tasks. The notebook leverages popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow to preprocess data, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Contents

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib.pyplot`
    - `seaborn`
    - `sklearn.preprocessing`
    - `sklearn.model_selection`
    - `sklearn.metrics`
    - `tensorflow.keras.utils`
    - `tensorflow.keras.layers`
    - `tensorflow.keras.models`
    - `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image`
    - `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text`
    - `os`

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Label encoding and scaling of features.
    - Train-test split for model evaluation.

3. **Model Building**:
    - Construction of various neural network layers (e.g., Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, LSTM, Dense, Dropout, Embedding).
    - Model compilation and training.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Calculation of confusion matrix and classification report.
    - Visualization of results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Setup
