# K-Means Clustering of Pin Codes

## Description
This Jupyter notebook performs K-Means clustering on a dataset containing geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) associated with pin codes. The primary objective is to identify clusters of pin codes based on their geographical proximity.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Open the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook `epoch_task1_up.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells sequentially to perform K-Means clustering on the dataset.
3. **Visualization**: The notebook visualizes the clusters and centroids on a scatter plot.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Examples
### K-Means Clustering Scatter Plot
The notebook produces a scatter plot with clusters of pin codes visualized in different colors, and the centroids marked with red 'x' symbols.

### Cluster Information
The notebook prints information about each cluster, including the number of points in each cluster and the coordinates of the centroids.

```
Cluster 0:
Number of Points: 1530
Centroid: [26.59542843 80.66075713]
Cluster 1:
Number of Points: 117
Centroid: [73.14601443 26.18788977]
```
